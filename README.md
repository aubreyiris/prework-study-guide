# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I created this Study Guide so that I can have quick acess to notes and as a way to learn and practice my new coding skills.
-It makes it easy for me to acess notes without having to go back over the prework module.
- In making this I learned a little bit about HtML, CSS and Java Script as well as how to use Git.  
-Doing this project have given me some foundational skills so that I can be better prepared to start the bootcamp.
